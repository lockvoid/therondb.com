# Sustainable Theron Documentation with Jekyll

We recently released [the Theron documentation](../docs). We have been looking
for a solution where we can write documentation and blog posts in Markdown,
versioning them via Git and reviewing them via pull requests. After some
research, we decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as an engine for our
blog and documentation. Now, we get to focus on writing content using our
favorite plain-text editor, getting feedback on GitHub, and easily deploying
changes.

## Under the Hood

We prepared [the guides](../docs/guide/installing-theron.html) that explain most
of the aspects of how Theron works, how it helps build modern realtime
application, and covered [our current API](../docs/api/Theron.html).  [The
screencasts](/#screencasts) on the landing page are also a good compliment to
the Theron learning process. Now we’re looking forward to the Theron beta
release.

## Real World Example

Last but not least, we [open sourced](https://github.com/rosendi/figure) a
complete, production-ready application [Figure](https://figure-app.com) powered
by Theron. It’s a handy companion for static sites that gives developers and
designers - tech-savvy individuals like you - a place to point form submissions,
handle the processing, transform input data, and finally, interact with users by
redirecting them to another page.

## Consequences

At Theron, we strive to be awesome as much and as often as possible. We are
constantly working to improve all of these scenarios and have several API
enhancements in the pipeline. The documentation is [open-sourced](https://github.com/rosendi/therondb.com).
If you find a mistake or want to improve something, please send a pull request.
We really appreciate it.
