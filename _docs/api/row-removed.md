# ROW_REMOVED (constant)

This action type will be emitted every time a row should be removed from a
dataset. The action type is emitted not only when a row has been removed from a
database, i.e. it will be emitted, too, when the row isnâ€™t required for
constructing the latest dataset for a SQL query.
